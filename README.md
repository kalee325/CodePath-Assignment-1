## Notes

Although there are walkthrough videos that I could follow as I was finishing this app, I found some errors when I tried to run the app. For example, I ran into the error "Thread 1: signal SIGABRT". I fixed this error by checking if I was working on the correct swift files and the syntax of the code.
